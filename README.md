# Numerical_Methods_1
Implementations of solutions to the problems we faced during the Numerical Methods classes. First of all, these are the following. problems: solving systems of equations using elementary operations on matrices - Gauss, Gauss-Jordan and Gauss methods with a middle element. Solutions to problems that Horner's and Heron's algorithms implement. Matrix multiplication and sum. Solutions of the following equations. methods: Method L and Method U.
